# Redirect

http://github.com/p8/redirect/tree/master

## Description
Redirect is a simple Ruby redirect DSL built on Rack.
It's like a simple Ruby mod_rewrite, so you can write and test your redirects in Ruby.

## Getting started
- Install the gem `gem install redirect`
- Create a new redirect rack app: `redirect_app my_redirect_app`
- This creates a directory called `my_redirect_app` with the required files and tests.
- Open `my_redirect_app/my_redirect_app.rb` in your favorite editor and add some redirect rules.

To run the app locally just run the main rb file: `ruby my_redirect_app.rb`.

## Defining redirects
Redirects are processed in the same order as they are defined:

    redirect  ['/catch_url', '/redirect_url'], ['/catch_url2', '/redirect_url2']

The first one is evaluated first, then the next one, etc..              
The catch_url can be a regular expression:

    ['^/some_regexp', '/all']
    [/old\/(.*)/, '/new/$1']  # /old/2008/02/01 will be redirected to /new/2008/02/01

You can also pass extra options as follows:

    :code # Overwrite the http code (defaults is 301) in the options,
    :name # named redirects are public so they'll appear in you sitemap.
    ['/catch_url', '/redirect_url', {:code => 307, :name => 'redirect link'}]`

The default redirect code can be changed by specifying:

    Redirect.default_code = 307

All redirects with a name will be specified in the generated /sitemap.xml.
